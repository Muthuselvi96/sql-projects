**Project Aim**

To apply relational database design principles and SQL logic to model and query complex real-world business cases. The project focuses on understanding entity relationships, designing ERDs, and interpreting relational constraints through practical scenarios from telecom, publishing, retail, art museums, and utility services.
 **Scope**

Analyze business problems and convert them into relational models and E-R diagrams

Identify cardinalities, degrees of relationships, and normalization requirements

Practice SQL logic in interpreting relationships and querying structured data

Solve domain-specific data modeling problems across multiple industries:

Cellular plans and devices

Book publishing and authorship

Art museum collections and exhibitions

Utility billing and customer-location management
**Process**

E-R Diagram Analysis:
Explored and interpreted provided ER diagrams and answered key relationship questions based on cardinality and entity behavior.

Scenario-Based Modeling:
Designed original ERDs for complex, multi-entity systems, including:

Book-author-publisher relationships with royalty logic

Museum asset tracking and gallery loans

Customer-location-rate linkage for utility billing systems

Conceptual to Logical Transition:
Translated high-level business rules into accurate database designs, clearly documenting all assumptions and modeling decisions.

**Impact & Learning Outcomes**

Strengthened ability to design normalized database structures that reflect real-world business logic

Gained hands-on experience with interpreting and representing complex relationships across multiple domains

Built a strong foundation in data modeling, integrity constraints, and relationship design

Prepared for practical applications of SQL through understanding how databases are constructed and queried from the ground up
