**Overview**
Welcome to my SQL project portfolio — a curated collection of real-world data analysis tasks using SQL across multiple domains including retail, finance, healthcare, and marketing.

As a data analyst, SQL is the foundation of my analytical workflow. These projects reflect how I use SQL not just to retrieve data, but to solve business problems, uncover trends, and support decision-making.


**What I used**
Optimized queries using joins, aggregations, filtering, subqueries, and set operators

Domain-specific tasks such as sales performance tracking, product analysis, regional segmentation, and transaction insights

Clean result snippets and business interpretations for each query


**Why It Matters**
SQL is more than a querying language — it’s a problem-solving tool. This portfolio shows how I:

Extract insights from large, relational datasets

Structure data for reporting and dashboarding tools

Enable data-driven strategies through efficient querying

Each project demonstrates how SQL skills can directly impact business clarity, reporting accuracy, and strategic planning.
