** Universal Bank Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction **
Project Overview
Universal Bank, a rapidly growing financial institution, has a strong base of liability customers (depositors) but a much smaller base of asset customers (borrowers). Loans generate higher revenue for the bank through interest income. Hence, the bankâ€™s goal is to increase its personal loan customer base by converting existing depositors into borrowers.

A previous marketing campaign offered personal loans to existing customers and achieved a conversion rate of around 9.6%. Encouraged by this success, the bank aims to improve future campaigns by targeting customers more precisely using predictive modeling.

This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine the likelihood that an existing customer will accept a personal loan offer. The chosen technique for this analysis is the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm.
Project Scope
The scope of this project includes:

Preparing and exploring the Universal Bank dataset containing 5,000 customer records with:

Demographic attributes (Age, Income, Education, Family size, etc.)

Financial behavior (CCAvg, Mortgage, Securities Account, CD Account, Online Banking usage, Credit Card usage, etc.)

Response to the last personal loan offer (Personal Loan)

Partitioning data into training and holdout sets for robust model evaluation

Developing and evaluating a k-NN classifier:

Identifying the best value of k for optimal model performance

Assessing model performance using confusion matrices and metrics like sensitivity

Using the trained model to predict whether new customers will accept a personal loan offer

Providing actionable insights to help the bank:

Reduce marketing costs

Improve campaign success rates

Grow its asset customer base.

Analyst Work
Loaded and explored data to understand customer demographics and behaviors.

Converted categorical variables to factors for proper modeling.

Split data into training (70%) and holdout (30%) sets.

Built initial k-NN model (k=1) to predict loan acceptance.

Tested predictions on a new hypothetical customer.

Performed cross-validation to identify the best k (k=11).

Reclassified the new customer using the optimal model for more accurate results.

Tool Used: R programming language with packages: class, gmodels, and caret.
